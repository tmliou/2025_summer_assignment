# rubik-js
A WebGL Rubik's cube. 

[See it in action](http://joews.github.io/rubik-js/). It requires a WebGL-capable browser.

Features

 * Shuffle
 * Click and drag plane rotation
 * Solve (by replaying moves in reverse)

This was a learning exercise in [Three.js](http://threejs.org/), and there are plenty of rough edges. TODO list:

 * Better lighting and materials
 * Support for non-WebGL browsers
 * A general solver algorithm
 * Awareness of puzzle completion, possibly with some celebratory 3D effects
 * Touch support
